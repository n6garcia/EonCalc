# EonCalc

EonCalc is a cython project for the brand new reductive proof (R-Algebra) method I've devised!

I am calling this Informal Math. I hope this will be a competitor to numpy and pytorch.

I have devised a superset of Algebra that surprisingly still keeps one critical rule, x =|x !

# Complex Number Analysis
An Informal Number x from X is a complex number with an imaginary component restricted to R/Q.

scratch work:

[ i 1 | 1 i ] x [ i 1 | 1 i ] = [ 0 2i | 2i 0 ]

so ...

e^2 - 1 =| x =| 0 

-1 + ei =| 0 

e^2 + ei =| {hard dirac} 

then ...

[ i e | e i ] x [ i e | i e ] = [ 0 {hard dirac} | 0 {hard dirac} ]

so,

e^i = +/- 1


## Scratch Informal Algebra:
how,

{hard dirac} =| 2ei

e^2 =| 1

2ei =| e^2 + ei

0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ei =| -1 + ei

=>

e^2 =| +/> 1

## Group Theory Proof

e^2 =| +> 1

e^2 =| ei

0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ei

e^2 =| 0

e^2 =| 1-1

an informal number is from the set X of informal numbers.

1. e^2 - 1 =| 0 <=> 1*1 =| 0*1 =| 0 <=> 1/0 =| 0 =| 0
   
   -1 + e^2 =| 0
   
   -1 + 0 =| 0
   
   x =| 0

2. -1 + ei =| 0 <=> x =| x

3. e^2 + ei =| 0 <=> {end of induction?}

## Informal Number Theory

[ Write Here ]

axiom 1. {hard dirac} =| 2ei =| e^2 + ei =| +/> 1 + ei

## Informal Calculus

e^2 =| +> 1 =| 1-1 =| 0 =| 1/0 =| x =| ei =| {hard dirac}

-< 1 |=| ei ?

+> 1 |=| -< 1 ?

+> 1 |=| -< 1

+> 1 =| 0 + 0/0 =| 0+0 =| {hard dirac} =| 0-0 =| 0 - 0/0 =|-< 1

+> 2 =| 1 + 1/1 =| 1 + 1

+>2 =| 2

+> 1 =| 1

-< 1 =| -1

e^2 =| +> 1

e^2 =| 0

e^2 =| 1-1

e^2 |=| x-x =| x+x

e^2 =| +>x |=| 2x

## Algebra

e^i = +/- 1 *(1)

e^i*pi + 1 = 0  # eulers identity

(+/- 1)^pi + 1 =| 0

(+/- 1) + 1 =| 0

e^i + 1 =| 0

e^i =| -1

iln(e) = ln(-1)

iln(e) = i*pi # ln(-1) = i*pi

i = i*pi # ln(e) = 1

=>

sqrt(1) = +/- 1 = e^i =| -1

=> 

sqrt(1) + 1 = 0

sqrt(n*n) + n = 0 

+/- n + n = 0

=>

sqrt(-1) = i = i*pi = iln(e) = ln(-1) = ln(e^i)

e^sqrt(-1) = e^i = e^ln(e^i)

=>

sqrt(-n) = sqrt(n)*i = sqrt(n)*ln(e^i)


## Zermelo-Set Theory Completeness Proof

Geometric Reductive Proof (Symbol Ordering)

{Endian Math} =* {Induction}

= * =| =|

then...

E =* x |=| x |=| 0 *= I

E =| I therefore, QED.

Here are some thoughts on the equations and expressions you've written:

    Imaginary Unit and Euler's Identity: You mention relations like e^i = +/- 1, which seems inspired by Euler's identity eiπ+1=0eiπ+1=0. You might be proposing alternative forms or interpretations of these fundamental relationships.
    
    Hypothesis on Unit Element: You're proposing ii as a unit element for irrational and imaginary numbers, a novel idea that might require redefinition of operations in those number sets.

    Algebraic Structures: You have matrices like [i,1∣1,i][i,1∣1,i] and [i,e∣e,i][i,e∣e,i]. It's unclear if these represent transformations, solutions, or something else. Clarifying the operations and contexts could be helpful.

    Group Theory: You're exploring group-like structures, as seen in expressions like e2=∣+>1e2=∣+>1. Clarifying how these relate to traditional group theory concepts (identity, inverses, operations) would aid understanding.

    Clarify Notations: Since you're introducing new symbols (=|, |=|, etc.), it would be helpful to formalize their meanings and applications.
