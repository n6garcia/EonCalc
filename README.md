# EonCalc

EonCalc is a cython project for the brand new reductive proof (R-Algebra) method I've devised!

I am calling this Informal Math. I hope this will be a competitor to numpy and pytorch.

I have devised a superset of Algebra that surprisingly still keeps one critical rule, x =|x !

# Introduction
A real number r could be 2.2 or pi. pi is irrational. A collection of irrational imaginary numbers is an informal number.
An informal numberis an extension of irrational numbers in irrational and imaginary number theory.
an imaginary irrational number breaks vector math.
vector math on IR/Q numbers is still an "open" prize within mathematics.

hypothesis:
the unit element of IR/Q is i?

2x2 cases enumerated:
[ i 1 | 1 i ] x [ i 1 | 1 i ] = [ 0 2i | 2i 0 ]

so ...

e^2 +- 1 = x = 0 ?

-1 + ie = 0 ?

e^2 + ie = {hard dirac} ?

then ...

[ i e | e i ] x [ i e | i e ] = [ 0 {hard dirac} | 0 {hard dirac} ]

so,

e^i = +/- 1


## Scratch R-Algebra:
how,

{hard dirac} =| 2ie

e^2 =| 1

2ie =| e^2 + ie

0 + 2ie =| e^2 + ie =| -1 + ie

=>

e^2 =| +/> 1

## Group Theory of Informal Math.

e^2 =| +> 1

0 + 2ie =| e^2 + ie

e^2 =| 0

e^2 =| 1-1

an informal number is from the set X of informal numbers.

1. e^2 - 1 =| 0 <=> 1*1 =| 0*1 =| 0 <=> 1/0 =| 0 =| 0
   
   -1 + e^2 =| 0
   
   -1 + 0 =| 0
   
   x =| 0

2. -1 + ie =| 0 <=> x =| x

3. e^2 + ie =| 0 <=> {end of induction?}

## Theory/Algebra

[ Write Here ]

axiom 1. {hard dirac} =| 2ie =| e^2 + ie =| +/> 1 + ie

## Informal Calculus

e^2 =| +> 1 =| 1-1 =| 0 =| 1/0 =| x =| ie =| {hard dirac}

-< 1 |=| ie ?

+> 1 |=| -< 1 ?

## Informal Algebra

+> 1 |=| -< 1

+> 1 =| 0 + 0/0 =| 0+0 =| {hard dirac} =| 0-0 =| 0 - 0/0 =|-< 1

+> 2 =| 1 + 1/1 =| 1 + 1

+>2 =| 2

+> 1 =| 1

-< 1 =| -1

e^2 =| +> 1

e^2 =| 0

e^2 =| 1-1

e^2 |=| x-x =| x+x

e^2 =| +>x |=| 2x

## Zermelo-Set Theory Completness Proof

Geometric Reductive Proof (Symbol Ordering?)

{Endian Math} =* {Induction}

= * =| =|

then...

E =* x |=| x |=| 0 *= I

E =| I therefore, QED.

Here are some thoughts on the equations and expressions you've written:

    Imaginary Unit and Euler's Identity: You mention relations like e^i = +/- 1, which seems inspired by Euler's identity eiπ+1=0eiπ+1=0. You might be proposing alternative forms or interpretations of these fundamental relationships.
    
    Hypothesis on Unit Element: You're proposing ii as a unit element for irrational and imaginary numbers, a novel idea that might require redefinition of operations in those number sets.

    Algebraic Structures: You have matrices like [i,1∣1,i][i,1∣1,i] and [i,e∣e,i][i,e∣e,i]. It's unclear if these represent transformations, solutions, or something else. Clarifying the operations and contexts could be helpful.

    Group Theory: You're exploring group-like structures, as seen in expressions like e2=∣+>1e2=∣+>1. Clarifying how these relate to traditional group theory concepts (identity, inverses, operations) would aid understanding.

    Clarify Notations: Since you're introducing new symbols (=|, |=|, etc.), it would be helpful to formalize their meanings and applications.
