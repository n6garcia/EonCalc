# EonCalc

EonCalc is a cython project for the brand new reductive proof method I've devised!

I am calling this Informal Math.

I have devised a superset of Algebra that only keeps one rule, x=|x ...

## TRANSCRIBED NOTES (be warned)
A real number r could be 2.2 or pi. pi is irrational. A collection of irrational imaginary numbers is an informal number.
An informal numberis an extension of irrational numbers in irrational and imaginary number theory.
an imaginary irrational number breaks vector math.
vector math on IR/Q numbers is still an "open" prize within mathematics.

hypothesis:
the unit element of IR/Q is i?

2x2 cases enumerated:
[ i 1 | 1 i ] x [ i 1 | 1 i ] = [ 0 2i | 2i 0 ]

so ...

e^2 +- 1 = x = 0
-1 + ie = 0
e^2 + ie = {hard dirac}

then ...

[ i e | e i ] x [ i e | i e ] = [ 0 {hard dirac} | 0 {hard dirac} ]

so ...

e^i = +/- 1

## Scratch R-Algebra:

{hard dirac} =| 2ie

e^2 =| 1

2ei =| e^2 + ie

0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ie =| -1 +ie

=>

e^2 =| +/- 1

## Group Theory of Informal Math.

e^2 =| +> 1
0 + 2ie =| e^2 + ie
e^2 =| 0
e^2 =| 1-1

an informal number is from the set X of informal numbers.

1. e^2 - 1 =| 0 <=> 1*1 =| 0*1 =| 0 <=> 1/0 =| 0 =| 0
   
   -1 + e^2 =| 0
   
   -1 + 0 =| 0
   
   x =| 0

2. -1 + ie =| 0 <=> x =| x

3. e^2 + ie =| 0 <=> {end of induction?}

## Theory/Algebra

[ Write Here ]

axiom 1. {hard dirac} =| 2ie =| e^2 + ie =| +/- 1 + ie

Informal Calculus

e^2 =| +> 1 =| 1-1 =| 0 =| 1/0 =| x =| ie =| {hard dirac}

-< 1 |=| ie ?

+> 1 |=| -< 1 ?

## Informal Algebra Scratch ...

+> 1 |=| -< 1

+> 1 =| 0 + 0/0 =| 0+0 =| {hard dirac} =| 0-0 =| 0 - 0/0 =|-< 1

+> 2 =| 1 + 1/1 =| 1 + 1

+>2 =| 2
+> 1 =| 1
-< 1 =| -1

e^2 =| +> 1
e^2 =| 0
e^2 =| 1-1
e^2 |=|
